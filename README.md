### REQUIREMENTS:
 ‚óè	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

### PROCEDURE:

### Assembly of Polar 3D Printer
 1.	Select 'Assembly of Polar 3D Printer' from the visible list.
 2.	All the parts related to Polar 3D Printer will be shown on the screen.
 3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
 4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
 5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
 6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

### Playing with Axes
 1.	Move the r-axis slider and observe the movement of the r-axis assembly.
 2.	Move the y-axis slider and observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
 3.	Move the z-axis slider and observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.
